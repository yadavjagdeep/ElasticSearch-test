"At its core, you can think of Elasticsearch as a server that can process JSON requests and give you back JSON data."


                                '''ElasticSearch  Topics'''

Cluster and Node:

When we are staring an elasticsearch instance, we are starting a node. An Elasticsearch cluster is a group
of nodes that have same cluster name. As node joins and leaves the cluster, the cluster automatically 
recognizes itself to evenly distribute data accross the available nodes.

# nodes are added to a cluster to increase its capability and reliability

Index:

Index is similar to a table in relational database which store documents having a perticular schema
in JSON format

Documents:

These are basically records in an index just like a row in relational database. Each document has a JSON 
format, a unique _id assosited to it and pertains to a specific mapping.

Fields:

These are basically attributes of a document just like coloumns in relational database.

Shards:

ElasticSearch splits the documents in the index across multiple nodes in the cluster. Each and every split
of the document is called a shard. Each node carrying a shard will have only a subset of document.
Suppose we have 100 document with 5 shard then each shard will have 20 doc each. This sharding of data
is what makes low latency search possible in elasticsearch


Replica:

Search is conducted parallel on multiple nodes. Results are aggregated and returned. However the shards does
not provide fault tolerance, meaning if anynode containing a shard is down, the cluster health becomes
yellow, which implies some data is not available.

To increase the fault tolerance replicas comes into picture. By default elastic search create a single 
replica of each shard. These replicas are always created on a node where primary shard is not residing.

Mapping Type:

To create different types in an index we need mapping types(or simply mapping) to be specified during
index creation. Mappings can be defined as a list of a directives given to elasticsearch about how data 
is supposed to be stored and retrived. It is important to provide mapping information at the of index 
creation based on how we want to retrive our data later

Alias:

Alias is used to group a number of index under a single name
Alis are basically created to group a set of indices and make them accessible regarless the name they have,
it is apointer to a set of indices, we can apply a query/condition to all these indies, it is very useful 
when performing a queries or creating a dashboard over the same group of indices
